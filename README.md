## qb-turnout

qb-turnout is my first ever released FiveM/lua script, you open the menu by simply running the command `/turnout`, it enables the turnout gear on/off with a neat little animation. Hope you enjoy and feel free to modify  this to your liking. You may fork this repository with your own modifications but you **CANNOT** re-upload as your own repository.
